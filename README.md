# responsive-navbarbyside
Here we fixed the navbar and defined height width on rem vh and vw and used transistion for animations and for the text we initially hide it but when its hovered over text display  and then we simply put each navlinks on flex box so that when we hover we can see icon and text both together then we put some hover effects then we did media query by setting navbar from left to bottom using botttm:0  then finally we set column back to row and gave navbar 100vw,
